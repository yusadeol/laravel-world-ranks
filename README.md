# World Ranks

The challenge was to build a country ranking page that accurately followed the provided design. I also developed a complete back-end capable of delivering dynamic country data such as population, area (in km²), and flags, all generated for demonstration purposes. The project was built using PHP with the Laravel framework, integrated with InertiaJS and VueJS, ensuring a robust structure and a smooth, dynamic front-end experience.

## Description
World Ranks is a fully functional demonstration project that simulates a country ranking system. It provides dynamically generated country information and showcases an integration between Laravel, InertiaJS, and VueJS to create a modern, interactive application. The focus of the project is to replicate a clean design, demonstrate API handling, and present dynamic UI updates through an optimized full-stack workflow.
